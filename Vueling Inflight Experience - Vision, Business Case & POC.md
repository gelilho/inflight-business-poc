# Vueling Inflight Experience — Vision, Business Case & POC

> **Read time: 8 minutes**

> **One line:** An AI-powered digital platform that turns every Vueling flight into a personalized journey — content, entertainment, food ordering, transport recommendation and passenger intelligence — from one booking number and from every single passenger.

---

## 1. The Problem

34 million passengers spend over 60 million hours a year in our aircraft — with zero digital engagement.

Today, a Vueling passenger boards, puts on their headphones, and disconnects. They bring their own entertainment. They skip food because the ordering process isn't convenient. When they land, they google everything about their destination on someone else's platform. When they need help, they call a hotline or wait for crew.

We own the most captive, high-intent audience in travel — and we do nothing with it.

| Pain Point | Who Feels It |
|---|---|
| No personalized content — passengers bring their own entertainment | Passengers |
| Food service depends on a physical cart — low conversion, low convenience | Passengers / Revenue |
| Paper magazine nobody reads — cost, waste, no engagement data | Sustainability / Brand |
| Passengers google their destination on other platforms | Product / Revenue |
| When passengers need help, they call a hotline or wait for crew | Passengers / Operations |
| No data on what passengers want, read, eat, or prefer | Data / Strategy |

**The core insight:** We have the attention. We have the context (destination, language, timing). We have the distribution channel (app + WiFi). We just aren't using any of it.

---

## 2. The Vision

Transform every Vueling flight into the best few hours of a passenger's day.

**The Vueling Inflight Experience** is a single digital platform — delivered through the Vueling app and inflight WiFi — that combines personalized destination content, immersive entertainment, real-time flight information, food pre-ordering, and self-service help. All AI-powered. All in the passenger's language. All from one booking number and from every single passenger.

It starts as a content platform, evolves into a commerce engine, and matures into the most personal relationship a low-cost carrier has ever had with its passengers.

## 4. The Passenger Journey

The experience doesn't start at boarding. It starts **24 hours before the flight** and continues **after landing**.

```
T-24h ─── BEFORE THE FLIGHT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  │
  ├─ Silent push: all content pre-cached on device (~15-25 MB)
  ├─ Push notification: "Flying to Rome tomorrow? Pre-order your menu"
  └─ Passenger opens app → browses menu → orders → pays → "Lunch or snacks booked!"

T-3h ─── AT THE AIRPORT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  │
  ├─ After check-in: "Checked in! Explore Rome while you wait"
  ├─ After luggage drop: "Luggage done! Add a snack bag?"
  ├─ After security: "You're through! Want a picnic bag for your flight?"
  └─ At the gate: full experience already loaded — music, magazine, destination

T-0 ─── BOARDING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  │
  ├─ Vueling App: detects WiFi → loads pre-cached experience instantly
  ├─ WiFi Portal: enter PNR/Vueling club → content served from onboard edge cache
  └─ Welcome screen: crew names, aircraft, destination, food, music, FAQ

T+15min ─── CRUISING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  │
  ├─ Browse all content (offline): highlights, restaurants, magazine, music
  ├─ Pre-orders delivered first, then live orders by seat number
  ├─ Food ordering goes live: digital menu → cart → pay → crew delivers
  └─ Live flight tracker: real-time map

T-30min ─── APPROACHING DESTINATION ──────────────────────────────────────
  │
  ├─ "30 minutes to Rome!"
  ├─ Weather on arrival + transport summary + baggage carousel
  └─ Emergency contacts surfaced

LANDING ─── POST-FLIGHT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  │
  ├─ "Welcome to Rome! Rate your experience?"
  ├─ NPS survey + optional feedback
  └─ Destination guide stays accessible for the whole trip
```

## 5. The Food Revenue Engine

The pillar that **pays for the entire platform**.

**Three moments to capture a sale:**
- **T-24h** — Pre-order via push notification → guaranteed revenue before departure
- **T-3h** — Airport push after security → snack bag upsell
- **T+15min** — Onboard digital menu → tap, order, pay, crew delivers

**Why this matters:**
- Pre-orders = revenue locked in before the plane departs
- Digital menus with photos = +30% average order value vs. aisle cart
- Pre-orders as demand signal = smarter catering, -20% food waste
- Crew efficiency = pre-orders prepared in advance, -15% aisle service time

**Revenue projection (Year 1, conservative):** 8% of 34M passengers x 10 EUR avg. = ~27M EUR in pre-order revenue alone. Plus onboard digital ordering. Plus reduced waste. The food vertical alone has standalone ROI.

## 6. Why Now?

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **AI maturity** | Gemini 2.5 Flash can generate production-quality, multilingual content at near-zero cost. This wasn't possible 18 months ago. |
| **Inflight WiFi rollout** | Vueling's fleet is getting connected — we can now deliver real-time experiences (food orders, payments, flight tracker) on top of pre-cached content. |
| **Passenger expectation shift** | Post-pandemic travelers expect digital-first experiences. The gap between "premium airline" and "low-cost carrier" experience is closing — through software, not infrastructure. |
| **Long-haul benchmark** | Passengers experience personalized entertainment, food ordering, and destination content on long-haul flights. They expect the same on short-haul. Vueling can be the first to deliver it. |
| **MWC 2026** | The POC is built, working, and demo-ready. Three cities, six languages, live API. This is the moment to demonstrate capability and vision. |
| **Revenue urgency** | Ancillary revenue is the growth engine for LCCs. Food pre-ordering alone has standalone ROI — 8% conversion x 34M passengers x ~10 EUR = ~27M EUR/year. |

## 7. KPIs & Business Impact

| Category | Metric | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Engagement** | Activation rate | >25% in 6 months |
| **Engagement** | Avg. session duration | >12 minutes |
| **Revenue** | Food pre-order conversion | >8% of passengers |
| **Revenue** | AOV uplift (digital vs. aisle) | +30% |
| **Satisfaction** | NPS lift (users vs. non-users) | +5 points |
| **Operational** | Crew aisle service time reduction | -15% |
| **Sustainability** | Food waste reduction | -20% |
| **Sustainability** | Catering demand forecast accuracy | >85% |

**Cost per passenger: ~0.005 EUR.** Against food revenue, the ROI is 160x-240x.

**North Star Metric:** Passenger Lifetime Value (PLV) delta — do experience users fly more, spend more, and recommend Vueling more?

## 8. Technical Architecture

### Three Principles: Offline-first. Pre-computed. Minimal satellite.

Content is never generated per-request. Everything is produced on scheduled cadences and cached before the passenger boards.

| Content | Cadence | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Destination content (including translations to top 6 languages) | Every 2 weeks | Google Gemini AI |
| Flight details (crew, aircraft) | Daily | Airline ops systems |
| Weather | Every 12 hours | Google Gemini AI |
| News | Every 6 hours | Google Gemini AI (safety rules in prompt) |
| Music playlists | Weekly | AI Curation Engine |
| Magazine | Weekly | Gemini + Editorial |
| FAQ | On change | Vueling systems |

### Delivery: Silent Push + Edge Caching

**App users:** T-24h, a silent push downloads the full content package. At boarding, everything loads instantly. Zero bandwidth.

**WiFi portal users:** Onboard edge cache server pre-loaded at the gate via ground WiFi. Content served at LAN speed — no satellite needed.

**Satellite budget per flight: ~370 KB.** Only flight tracker (~1KB/30s), food orders (~2KB/order), and payments (~1KB/txn) go over satellite. Less than a single webpage.

### AI Engine: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash

A single AI engine generates ALL content: destination highlights, restaurants, weather, news, transport options, and translations to 6 languages. One model. One prompt layer. One cost structure.

## 9. Future Vision: Hyperpersonalization

The Inflight Experience is not just a product — it's a **data flywheel**. Every pre-order, every article read, every playlist played, every FAQ searched is a preference signal.

**The objective:** treat every passenger like a VIP/Business customer — whether flying for holidays, leisure, or business.

| What We Learn | What We Do |
|---|---|
| Maria always orders Mediterranean | Menu opens with "Your usual?" — one-tap reorder |
| Carlos reads culture articles on every flight | Magazine opens with culture first |
| A family flies to Mallorca | Family content + kids' menu highlighted |
| Frequent flyer orders food on every trip | "Welcome back! Your 10th order is on us" |
| Monday BCN→MAD business traveler | Coffee + news-first layout, minimal destination content |

We scale the feeling of premium treatment through software, not physical infrastructure. Personal greetings. Remembered preferences. Curated offers. No extra cost per passenger — just smarter data.

**Predictive catering:** Aggregate pre-orders become a demand signal. We know what to load per route, per day, per season. Less waste. Lower cost. Fresher food.

## 11. POC Scope & Status

The POC demonstrates the core of the platform: a single API call with a booking number returns a complete, personalized inflight experience.

**What the POC does:**
- Takes a booking reference (PNR) and language
- Returns a full inflight experience: destination highlights, restaurant picks, weather, news, transport options, flight details, crew names, aircraft info
- All content generated by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash in real-time
- Frontend renders a clean, mobile-first UI
- Fallback-first: if the API fails, pre-computed mock data loads — the demo never breaks

**What the POC proves:**
- A single AI engine can generate all content types across multiple languages
- The architecture works: one API call, one booking number, one complete experience
- The UI is intuitive — no training, no explanation needed
- Content quality is production-ready out of the box
- Cost is negligible: ~0.005 EUR per passenger

**POC numbers:**
- 3 destinations: Rome, London, Paris
- 6 languages: es, en, fr, it, ca, gl
- 2 repos: Backend API (Python/FastAPI) + Frontend UI (React/Vite)
- Single AI engine: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- All endpoints tested and working
- Ready for MWC demo

**What the POC does NOT include (Phase 1+):**
- Food pre-ordering and payments
- Live flight tracker with real-time data
- Music streaming
- Digital magazine content
- Offline caching and silent push
- Passenger profiles and personalization

The POC is the foundation. Everything else is built on top of this same architecture.
