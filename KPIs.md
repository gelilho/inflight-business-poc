# KPIs & Metrics — Vueling Inflight Experience

## How We Measure Success

Every metric answers one of four questions:

1. **Are passengers using it?** → Engagement
2. **Are passengers happier?** → Satisfaction
3. **Is it making money?** → Revenue
4. **Is it saving money / improving operations?** → Operations & Sustainability

  34M passengers x 12% onboard  = 4.08M orders x  8 EUR = 32.6M EUR
  Net new after cannibalization: ~25-35M EUR incremental

If experience users fly more, spend more, and recommend Vueling more — the platform pays for itself.
