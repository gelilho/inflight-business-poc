# Vueling Inflight Experience

## SLIDE 1 — The Problem

**34 million passengers. 60 million hours. Zero digital engagement.**

A passenger boards a Vueling flight. They put on headphones. They switch to airplane mode. For the next two hours, they stare at their own phone with no content, no connection, and nothing from us.

When they're hungry, they wait for a cart. When they have a question, they flag down a crew member. When they land, they google their destination on someone else's platform.

We own the most captive audience in travel. We do nothing with it.

## SLIDE 2 — The Vision

**One booking number. One passenger. One complete experience.**

An AI-powered platform — inside the Vueling app — that auto-generates and auto-translates personalized content, food ordering, flight info, and self-service help for every single passenger. In their language. Works in airplane mode.

Content is pre-cached on the device 24h before the flight. No WiFi needed. The only things that touch satellite are food orders, payments, and the flight tracker — totaling ~370 KB per flight.

## SLIDE 3 — The Product

**10 pillars. One screen. Everything a passenger needs.**

| Pillar | What it delivers |
|---|---|
| **Food & snacks** | Pre-order or order onboard. Tap, pay, crew delivers to your seat. |
| **Flight details** | Aircraft, crew names, connecting flights with gate and terminal at destination. |
| **Flight live tracker** | Real-time map with the flight route, altitude, speed, and ETA. |
| **Destination guide** | Top highlights + restaurant picks — AI-generated and auto-translated. |
| **Getting to the city** | Train, bus, taxi — times, costs, bookable transfers — AI-generated and auto-translated. |
| **Weather & news** | 3-day forecast + curated local news — AI-generated and auto-translated. |
| **Music** | Destination playlists — local artists, mixed decades. |
| **Digital magazine** | Ling reborn digital — travel stories, tips, Vueling news. |
| **FAQ & help** | Searchable Vueling FAQ — answers without calling, without asking crew. |
| **Emergency info** | Police, hospital, Vueling helpline — always at hand. |

All destination content, transport info, weather, and news are generated by a single AI engine (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash) and automatically translated to 6 languages.

## SLIDE 4 — Business Imapct

**The food pillar alone pays for the platform.**

|                       | Metric                                   | Number        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Revenue**           | Food pre-order (8% of 34M pax x €10)    | **~€27M/year**|
| **Revenue**           | AOV uplift (digital menu vs. cart)       | **+30%**      |
| **Operations**        | Crew aisle time reduction                | **-15%**      |
| **Operations**        | Crew repetitive questions reduction      | **-40%**      |
| **Sustainability**    | Food waste reduction                     | **-20%**      |
| **Cost**              | AI content per passenger                 | **€0.005**    |
| **ROI**               | Food revenue vs. AI cost                 | **160x-240x** |

## SLIDE 5 — Architecture (vision)

**Offline-first. Pre-computed. Minimal satellite.**

Nothing is generated on the fly. An AI engine produces all content on scheduled cadences, caches it, and pushes it to devices before boarding.

_[Live API call + UI walkthrough]_

One booking number. One API call. A complete inflight experience.

The POC is built. The architecture works. The business case is clear.

**Every flight is a canvas. Every passenger is an audience of one.**
